1. o9 Solutions, Shanghai, China 08/2020-07/2021, Functional Consultant:

Configured the o9 platform based on the blueprint laid out during design to solve deep operations/supply chain problems for a global beverage company. Implemented a Supply Chain End-to-End Demand Planning Process. Implemented demand forecasting using machine learning models (Random Forest) in python, including Data Input & Pre-processing, SKU Segmentation, Feature Engineering, Training, Tuning, and Validation to increase the accuracy of the demand prediction by 10% for different data hierarchies. Involved multiple demand sensing drivers, including sales history, promotions, weather, holidays, macroeconomics data, significant events, and competitors’ data.

2. E&J Gallo, Ithaca, 11/2021-05/2022, Capstone Project
	
E&J Gallo Winery’s supply chain has three main stages: its own warehouses, distributors that purchase E&J products, and retail liquor stores. It is essential to note the following distinction between products moving from the warehouses to the distributors and from the distributors to the retailers. Shipments represent Gallo products moving from their warehouses to the distributors, and depletions represent products moving from the distributors to the retailers. This is visualized in Figure 1 below. In order to ensure demand is met, Gallo has been using forecasting methods to assist in predicting future demand, specifically future shipment values. Currently, their models have only been using historical shipment data to model future levels and have neglected the historical depletion values. With that being said, our end goal is to develop new forecasting methods which use both historical shipment and depletion values to forecast future monthly shipment values. We will be looking into methods that forecast monthly shipment values at the SKU level, where SKUs represent each unique product of the winery. Ultimately, E&J will compare our methods with theirs, and if we can come up with more accurate results, they will use our predictions for the following year.
